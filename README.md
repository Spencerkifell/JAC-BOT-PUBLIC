Current Version: 1.0

Summary:

In regards to the current pandemonium in result of COVID-19; Educational-Institutions have been shut down, leaving many students in the dark about their academic futures. Since most institutions have recently opted for online schooling for the time being, We took it upon ourselves using both JavaScript and Discord's API to create a bot that meets the needs of educators across the globe.
